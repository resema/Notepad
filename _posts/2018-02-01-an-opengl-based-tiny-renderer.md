## Tiny Real OpenGL Application
After completing the tutorial about building my own graphics pipeline. I will continue my journey to trully understand 3D graphics by looking at OpenGL.

### OpenGL Toolkit
I'm using GLFW v3.2.1 as a toolkit to manage windows and user inputs. It has been installed by means of Home Brew.
