## On-Board Estimation, Nonlinear Control And Swarms

### Sensing And Estimation
#### SLAM - Simultaneous Localization And Mapping Problem

### Nonlinear Control
From the earlier posts we saw that we always granted that the movement of the robot is in linear boundaries. But now, we want to extend this assumption and take also high positions and attitude changes into our calculation.

#### Trajectory Planning

#### Differential Flatness
All state variables and the inputs can be written as smooth functions of **flat ouputs** and their derivatives.

Or the other way around:
The flat outputs and their derivatives can be written as a function of the state, the inputs, and their derivatives.
