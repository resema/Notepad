# Resema's Blog

In this blog I write down little articles about stuff I read, see and want to remember, mostly in software developing related topics.

## Myself
I'm a professional C++ programmer, but I also love to programm inÂ C, Python, JavaScript and others. Since I travel a lot, I got addicted to coursera MOOCs, edx and Udacity. These platforms allow me to access easilier new fields.

## Topics
My journeys brought my to interesting places such as
- Machine learning
- Deep neural networks
- Artificial intelligence
- Robotics


The main reason for this blog is to help myself to look up things I read or learned. If it helps others I'm very happy.

Keep questioning,
Resema
