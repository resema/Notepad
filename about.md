My name is **Renato Semadeni** and this is my personal blog.  

I'm a Software Engineer, a Medical Physicist and a Biomechanical. I studied mostly at the ETH Zurich as well as at the HSR Rapperswil.

I love to remember stuff I looked at. But unfortunately with age, my brain doesn't get any bigger. So I started this block to write down what I'm visiting and learning. Maybe it can be to any use for some other persons with a brain like a swiss cheese.
